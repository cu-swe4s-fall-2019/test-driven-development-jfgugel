Test Driven Development

# math_lib.py
    # Created math_lib.py function to take the mean and standard deviation of an array of numbers
    # Mean function is called mean
    # Standard deviation function is called stdev
    # math_lib.py was designed driven by tests in test_math_lib.py
        # Tests in math_lib.py include:
            # None column
            # Empty column
            # Self assertion for easy calculation using given values
            # Self assertion for easy calculation using random values

# get_data.py
    # The purpose of get_data.py is to take in data from another file and prepare it for use in data_viz.py
    
# data_viz.py
    # dataviz.py has three functions:
        # Generate scatter plot
        # Generate histogram
        # Generate scatter plot / histogram combo plot
    # dataviz.py takes data from get_data.py
    # dataviz.py relies on mean and stdev functions from math_lib.py
